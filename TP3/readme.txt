Q*bert

Description:
This project is an attempt to clone Q*bert, a popular Atari console and arcade
game from the 1980's. The goal is for Q*bert to touch all cube tops while avoiding the 3 enemies, 
2 of which move at random, 1 that follows Q*bert. Once all cubes on the board are touched, the round ends. T here are 5 rounds increasing in difficulty depending on which cubes the green enemy undoes.  Scoring works as follows:

+50 touching a cube (only once per round)
+10 landing on enemy
-10 enemy landing on Q*bert
 
Manual movement proceeds with 'u', i', 'h, 'j', keys. There is also an auto-play option. 

How to run:
The user will need the files termProject.py, player.py, and cmu_112_graphics.py
